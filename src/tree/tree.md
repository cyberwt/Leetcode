*Binary Search Tree* is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
